About
=====

This is a repository to build conda packages for Astropy for use in continuous
integration on Travis and AppVeyor. The official conda channels include only
builds with the latest Numpy, for example Astropy 1.0 is available only with
Numpy 1.9. In this repository we build additional packages (such as Astropy 1.0
with Numpy 1.8) and upload these to the ``astropy-ci-extras`` binstar channel.
